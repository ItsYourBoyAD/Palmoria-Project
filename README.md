# Palmoria-Project
A Microsoft Power BI data visualisation report for a Capstone project I did regarding gender inequality within the Palmoria Group.

## The scenario
The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in the Nigeria is embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions.
Unfortunately, the media recently published in the news with the headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”.
This doesn’t look good for the owners of the business based on their ambition to scale the business to other regions and even overseas.
Cases like this can only spiral downwards revealing other issues like gender pay gap amongst other possible issues.
The CEO of Palmoria, Mr Ayodeji Chukwuma is keen to address these issues before it gets out of hands.
The CHRO, Mr. Yunus Shofoluwe has been assigned the task to identify key areas within the business that could spring up issues and address them immediately.
Mr. Shofoluwe decided to recruit you as a HR Analytics expert to analyse the company’s HR data and come up with recommendations for management’s attention.
“Now, the future of gender equality in Palmoria lies in your hands” the exact words of Mr. Shofoluwe before he handed the data to you

## The task
● Analyse the company data and generate insights that Palmoria management team would need to address
● Your analysis should be visualized using appropriate charts
● Your focus should be on gender related issues within the organization and its regions
● The insights required are based on your own discretion. However, Mr. Gamma as an insider has offered to give you pointers into areas you need to pay attention to
